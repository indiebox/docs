UBOS documentation
==============================

On-line at [ubos.net/docs](https://ubos.net/docs/)

* The main site is created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Sources are in separate
  repository [ubos-website](https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-website).
* The /docs subdirectory is created with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). Sources are in directory `sphinx`.

Branch `yellow` has the documentation for the `yellow` release channel; branch `master` has
it for the `green` release channel.

Note that the Sphinx parts use the CSS generated by Jekyll.
