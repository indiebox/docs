``ubos-admin status``
=====================

See also :doc:`../../users/ubos-admin`.

This command is intended as a general-purpose device status command. Eventually it
will emit "everything that's worth knowing about the state of the device".

It accomplishes this by invoking various Linux system commands, and reading configuration
files according to UBOS conventions.
