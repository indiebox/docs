Beta 4 Release Notes
====================

New features
------------

* **New app:** Mediagoblin, the GNU Project's photo and media sharing application, is now available
  on UBOS for single-command installation and management
  (`more about Mediagoblin <http://mediagoblin.org/>`_)

* **New app:** Webtrees, a full-featured web genealogy application, is now available
  on UBOS for single-command installation and management
  (`more about Webtrees <http://www.webtrees.net/>`_)

* **Major:** Applications on UBOS can now use the Postgresql database as an alternative
  to MySQL
  (`more about Postgresql <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL>`_)

* MySQL is not required any more for UBOS, and instead demand-installed like Postgresql or
  applications.

* UBOS now automatically generates an SSH key pair on a suitable flash drive (the
  "UBOS staff") during boot that enables password-less, secure SSH login to the UBOS device
  over the network, with minimal hassle for the user (the "UBOS shepherd"). Read
  :doc:`more about the UBOS staff <../../../users/shepherd-staff>`.

* Eliminate long initial boot times by activating pre-installed ``haveged``. Simply run
  ``systemctl enable haveged``.

* Automatic system reboot if an upgrade advises that. The single-command full-stack upgrade
  ``ubos-admin update`` now uses a heuristic whether a reboot is necessary (e.g. if the
  Linux kernel was updated). Options exist to override this heuristic
  (`ubos-admin issue 83 <https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-admin/issues/83>`_,
  `ubos-admin issue 43 <https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-admin/issues/43>`_)

* Better progress messages during long operations, e.g. generating the TLS keys for
  https websites
  (`ubos-admin issue 61 <https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-admin/issues/61>`_)

* New command ``ubos-admin status`` is beginning to report on the device status.
  Currently it only reports on manually modified configuration files, but over time, it
  have more to say.

* Applications can now specify that they need ``systemd`` services or timers. UBOS will
  activate/enable and deactivate/disable the corresponding services or timers when
  the application is deployed and undeployed. Mediagoblin already uses this for
  running background processing tasks.

  back to the named host
  (`ubos-tools issue 7 <https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-tools/issues/7>`_)

  proxy is available
