Run UBOS on Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
===============================

You can run UBOS on your Raspberry Pi 2 or Raspberry 3 by downloading an image, writing
it to an SD card, and booting your Raspberry Pi with that card. (Alternatively you can keep
running your existing Linux distro on your Raspberry Pi, and run UBOS in a Linux container.
This is :doc:`described here <armv7h_container>`.)

Raspberry Pi 2 "Model B" and Raspberry Pi 3 "Model B" are supported out of the box.
Raspberry Pi 3 "Model B+" should work as well.

If you are not sure which model you have, consult
`this page <http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/>`_.

If you have the original Raspberry Pi or the Raspberry Pi Zero, go to :doc:`this page <raspberrypi>`.
For the Raspberry Pi 4, go to :doc:`this page <raspberrypi4>`.

You may be bable to run UBOS from an external USB stick or disk, if your Raspberry Pi 3's
boot loader is fairly recent. We suggest to use an SD card first, and only try to boot from
an external USB stick or disk once you have UBOS booting from the SD card.

#. Download a UBOS boot image from ``depot.ubos.net``.
   Images for the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 are at
   `http://depot.ubos.net/green/armv7h/images <http://depot.ubos.net/green/armv7h/images>`_.
   Look for a file named ``ubos_green_armv7h-rpi2_LATEST.img.xz``.

#. Optionally, you may now verify that your image downloaded correctly by following the instructions
   at :doc:`verifying`.

#. Uncompress the downloaded file. This depends on your operating system, but might be as easy as
   double-clicking it, or executing

   .. code-block:: none

      % sudo xz -d ubos_green_armv7h-rpi2_LATEST.img.xz

   on the command line.

#. Write this image file "raw" to a micro-SD card. This operation depends on your operating system:

   * :doc:`/users/writing-image/windows`
   * :doc:`/users/writing-image/macosx`
   * :doc:`/users/writing-image/linux`

#. On first boot, it is recommended you have a monitor and keyboard connected to your
   Raspberry Pi 2. If this is impractical, create a :doc:`UBOS staff <../shepherd-staff>`
   so you can securely log in over the network without the need for monitor or keyboard.

#. Remove the micro-SD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi 2. If you created a UBOS staff,
   insert the staff into the USB port. Then, plug in the Raspberry Pi 2's USB power.

#. When the boot process is finished, log in as user ``root``
   (for password, see the :doc:`user FAQ </users/faq>`).
   If you used a UBOS staff,
   you can log in over the network instead as described :doc:`here <../shepherd-staff>`.

#. Now: wait. UBOS needs to generate a few cryptographic keys before it is ready to use
   and initialize a few other things on the first boot. That might take 5 or 10 minutes.
   To determine whether UBOS ready, execute:

   .. code-block:: none

      % systemctl is-system-running

   Wait until the output has changed from ``starting`` to ``running``. If it is anything else, consult
   :doc:`troubleshooting<../troubleshooting>`.

#. If you have Ethernet plugged in, and your network has a DHCP server (most networks do),
   your computer should automatically acquire an IP address. You can check with:

   .. code-block:: none

      % ip addr

   Make sure you are connected to the internet before attempting to proceed.

#. Update UBOS to the latest and greatest:

   .. code-block:: none

      % sudo ubos-admin update

#. You are now ready to :doc:`set up your first app and site </users/firstsite>`.
